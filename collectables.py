#     Modified to change cryptocurrency to collectables

# You are interested in buying collectables. 
# You want to check the current amount of money you have and see how many things you can buy in the categories of dolls, books and stamps.

# Create a program that:
    # Reads the total amount of money you have
    # Reads the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin
    # Prints the amount of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin you can buy
    # Example: money = 100, bitcoin_price = 50, ethereum_price = 25, litecoin_price = 10
    # Output: "With 100$ you can buy: 2 Bitcoins, 4 Ethereum, and 10 Litecoins"

# BEGIN PROGRAM

# DEFINE VARIABLES
    # money = the amount of money you have to spend in dollars
    # dolls = the price of dolls
    # books = the price of books
    # stamps = the price of stamps
