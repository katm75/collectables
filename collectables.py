You are interested in buying crypto-currencies. You want to check the current amount of money you have and see how many coins you can buy in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

Create a program that:

Reads the total amount of money you have
Reads the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin
Prints the amount of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin you can buy
Example: money = 100, bitcoin_price = 50, ethereum_price = 25, litecoin_price = 10
Output: "With 100$ you can buy: 2 Bitcoins, 4 Ethereum, and 10 Litecoins"
